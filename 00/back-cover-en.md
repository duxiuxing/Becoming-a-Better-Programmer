# Becoming a Better Programmer

If you're passionate about programming and want to get better at it, you've come to the right source. *Code Craft* author Pete Goodliffe presents a collection of useful techniques and approaches to the art and craft of programming that will help boost your career and your well-being.

Goodliffe presents sound advice that he's learned in 15 years of professional programming. The book's standalone chapters span the range of a software developer's life — dealing with code, learning the trade, and improving performance — with no language or industry bias. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a neophyte professional, or a hobbyist, you'll find valuable tips in five independent categories:

- Code-level techniques for crafting lines of code, testing, debugging, and coping with complexity

- Practices, approaches, and attitudes: keep it simple, collaborate well, reuse, and create malleable code

- Tactics for learning effectively, behaving ethically, finding challenges, and avoiding stagnation

- Practical ways to complete things: use the right tools, know what "done" looks like, and seek help from colleagues

- Habits for working well with others, and pursuing development as a social activity
